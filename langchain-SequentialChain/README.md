# Langchain Code Overview

This document provides an overview of the code's functionality and components.

## Practice Function

The code includes a `practice` function that demonstrates how to use Langchain. It queries the capital of a specified place using an OpenAI model.

## E-commerce Store Name Extraction

The code initializes Langchain to extract the name of an e-commerce store from a given product name.

## Product Name Extraction from E-commerce Store

Another Langchain instance is set up to extract comma-separated names of products based on a specified e-commerce store name.

## Overall Chain

An overall chain is created by combining the two Langchains mentioned above into a simple sequential chain.

## Synopsis and Review Chains

The code defines Langchain setups for generating play synopses and reviews based on input titles and eras. An `overall_chain` runs the synopsis and review chains in sequence.

## Agent Demo

The code demonstrates the usage of an agent with Langchain for zero-shot reactions and descriptions, using various tools.

## Memory in LLMs

A section in the code showcases the use of memory in Langchain's LLMs for storing and retrieving information.
